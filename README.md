Visual demonstration of genetic algorithms for Travelling Salesman Problem

This genetic algorithm tries to visually show the Travelling Salesman Problem. 
To visualize the roads, points are taken on a circumference, so it is easier to detect if the path is optimal. 
It can be configured to take randomly generated points, in addition to the basic parameters of the genetic algorithm.

The implementation relies in OpenGL library.
